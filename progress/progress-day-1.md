## 🔧 Project Setup & Structure
- [x] Created GitHub repo and cloned it locally
- [x] Initialized project with **Next.js 14 + App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**
- [x] Installed and configured **shadcn/ui**
- [x] Set up project folder structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── app/
  ├── components/
  ├── context/
  ├── lib/
  ├── styles/
  └── types/
  ```

## 🧱 Component Architecture
- [x] Defined a `Note` type in `types/index.ts`
